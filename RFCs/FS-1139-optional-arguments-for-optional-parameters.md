# Summary

We introduce easy-to-use default values to optional arguments in class methods.

# Motivation

The current way of doing it requires 2 attributes (Optional/OptionalArgument and DefaultValue) which comes as a surprise for both new and seasoned F# developers. To make it more easy to read and use F#, this syntax should be simplified the way it works across the industry.

This will also simplify interop code a lot.

Current way
```fsharp
type Foo =
    static member Bar([<System.Runtime.InteropServices.Optional>]
                      [<System.Runtime.InteropServices.DefaultParameterValue(42)>] arg: int) = arg

    // this way is compatible with C# 
    // as F# compiler emits [opt] parameter attribute with .params[1] = 43
    static member Baz([<FSharp.Core.OptionalArgument>]
                      [<System.Runtime.InteropServices.DefaultParameterValue(43)>] arg: int) = arg

Foo.Bar() // 42
Foo.Baz() // 43
```

First of all, this looks unnecessarily verbose, and second, there are two attributes both capable of making it work.
Also attribute `DefaultParameterValue` accepts object type as generic attributes are not implemented in F# yet.

# Detailed design

The proposal makes syntax much more succinct and close to what developers could expect.
The default value must be one of the following
- a literal
- enum or struct (but not a GENERIC struct)

This should work only for non-optional arguments as optional arguments in F# are compiled as ref type `FSharp.Core.Option<T>`

Example code:

```fsharp
type Enum = 
  | A = 0
  | B = 1

type CustomStruct = struct end

type Foo =
    static member Bar         (arg:  int = 42)     = arg
    static member BarInferred (arg       = 43)     = arg // should be inferred as int

    static member Enum        (arg: Enum = Enum.A) = arg
    static member EnumInferred(arg       = Enum.B) = arg // should be inferred as Enum

    static member Struct      (arg: CustomStruct = CustomStruct()) = arg

    // this is an existing functionality
    static member Opt(?arg: int) = arg
 
Foo.Bar()          // 42
Foo.BarInferred()  // 43
Foo.Enum()         // Enum.A
Foo.EnumInferred() // Enum.B
Foo.Struct()       // CustomStruct
Foo.Opt()          // None
```

Produced binaries with new syntax should be compiled the same way as the current solution with attributes for binary compatibility.
Therefore it should be compiled with both attributes
- `System.Runtime.InteropServices.OptionalArgumentAttribute`
- `System.Runtime.InteropServices.DefaultParameterValueAttribute`

```fsharp
open System.Runtime.InteropServices

type Enum = 
  | A = 0
  | B = 1

type CustomStruct = struct end

type Foo =
    // OK
    static member Bar   ([<OptionalArgument; DefaultParameterValue(42)>] arg: int) = arg
    static member Enum  ([<OptionalArgument; DefaultParameterValue(Enum.A)>] arg: Enum) = arg
    static member Struct([<OptionalArgument; DefaultParameterValue(CustomStruct())>] arg: CustomStruct) = arg
```

We should not allow default values preceding any other arguments without default values

```fsharp
type Foo =
  static member Bar(arg1 = 42, arg2: int) = arg1 + arg2 // should give a proper error about position of optional arguments
```

We should not allow non-constant values to be passed as default values as it could break on interop.
There is an existing error FS0267:
`This is not a valid constant expression or custom attribute value`
which is kind of correct, but could give a mixed feeling if we reuse it for default values of optional arguments (as a user doesn't know it will be compiled into attributes). Therefore we'll introduce a new error
```fsharp
type Foo =
    // All above should produce a compilation error
    // error FSXXXX: This is not a valid constant expression or struct value to pass as the default argument value. Make sure your argument is non-optional

    // ref type
    static member Array(arg: int list = [1;2;3]) = arg
    // generic struct
    static member Array(arg: int voption = ValueSome 1) = arg
    // optional argument
    static member Array(?arg: int = 1) = arg
```

# Drawbacks

Another way of doing the same.

Also, some interop issues and backward compatibility issues prevent us from properly utilizing it
 - Attribute values are expected to be constants or structs by both C# and F# specs

# Alternatives

Write overload for each needed combination
```fsharp
type Foo =
    static member Bar(?arg: int) = arg
    static member Bar() = Foo.Bar(42)

Foo.Bar() // Some 42
```

But with this alternative, it's not possible to assign default values to arbitrary arguments
```fsharp
type Foo =
    static member Bar(?arg1: int, ?arg2: int) = arg1, arg2
    // this method suppose to assign default value to arg1 ONLY, therefore arg2 is still there
    static member Bar(?arg2: int) = Foo.Bar(arg1 = 42, ?arg2 = arg2) // we pass 42 as arg1 default value

    // this method suppose to assign default value to arg2 ONLY, therefore arg1 is still there
    // but this produces a compilation error
    // error FS0438: Duplicate method. The method 'Bar' has the same name and signature as another method in type 'Foo'.
    static member Bar(?arg1: int) = Foo.Bar(?arg1 = arg1, arg2 = 43) // we pass 43 as arg2 default value

Foo.Bar() // Some 42
```

Also, the number of such overloads explodes non-linearly with the amount of optional arguments increases.

# Compatibility

Please address all necessary compatibility questions:

* Is this a breaking change?

  No

* What happens when previous versions of the F# compiler encounter this design addition as source code?

  Compilation failure

* What happens when previous versions of the F# compiler encounter this design addition in compiled binaries?

  Code compiles fine

* If this is a change or extension to FSharp.Core, what happens when previous versions of the F# compiler encounter this construct?
