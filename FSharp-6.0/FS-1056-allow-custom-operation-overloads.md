* [Approved in principle](https://github.com/fsharp/fslang-suggestions/issues/69#issuecomment-388558877)
* Implementation: [Completed](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/4949), [Part 2](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/pull/10171)
* Discussion: https://github.com/fsharp/fslang-design/issues/301

# Summary
[summary]: #summary

When using a custom operation inside a computation expression, that operation can't be used if its method has an overload. That check is made only when the method is used inside a computation expression and can be [surprising when it happens](https://github.com/SaturnFramework/Saturn/issues/47).

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

Computation expressions are useful to create domain specific languages. [Saturn](https://github.com/SaturnFramework/Saturn) is heavily based on them and is gaining a lot of traction as a web development framework which implements the server-side MVC pattern. As users get familiar when using CE-based APIs, more library developers can leverage that familiarity when designing a new library.

Enabling overloads can be used to hide the inner working of the API. In Saturn's case, the method `set_body` could be used to set the response body from a `byte array` or a `string`.

```fsharp    
    [<CustomOperation("set_body")>]
    member __.SetBody(state, value) : HttpHandler  = state >=> (setBody value)

    [<CustomOperation("set_body")>]
    member __.SetBody(state, value) : HttpHandler  = state >=> (setBodyFromString value)
```
Making the user use one keyword for `byte[]` and another for `string` would cause a worse experience.

Another unsupported feature that could be useful are optional arguments and arguments with the `[<ParamArray>]` attribute. That could enable computation expressions that are really expressive. With the following computation builder class:


```fsharp
type InputKind =
    | Text of placeholder:string option
    | Password of placeholder: string option

type InputOptions =
  { Label: string option
    Kind : InputKind
    Validators : (string -> bool) array }

type InputBuilder() =

    member t.Yield(_) = 
      { Label = None
        Kind = Text None
        Validators = [||] }
        
    [<CustomOperation("text")>]
    member this.Text(io,?placeholder) =
        { io with Kind = Text placeholder }
        
    [<CustomOperation("password")>]
    member this.Password(io,?placeholder) =
        { io with Kind = Password placeholder }
        
    [<CustomOperation("label")>]
    member this.Label(io,label) = 
        { io with Label = Some label }
        
    [<CustomOperation("with_validators")>]
    member this.Validators(io, [<ParamArray>] validators) =
        { io with Validators = validators }
    
let input = InputBuilder()

```

you could create inputs with the following code:

```fsharp
let name =
  input {
    label "Name"
    text
    with_validators
        (String.IsNullOrWhiteSpace >> not)
  }
        
let email =
  input {
    label "Email"
    text "Your email"
    with_validators
        (String.IsNullOrWhiteSpace >> not)
        (fun s -> s.Contains "@")
  }
        
let password =
  input {
    label "Password"
    password "Must contains at least 6 characters, one number and one uppercase"
    with_validators
        (String.exists Char.IsUpper)
        (String.exists Char.IsDigit)
        (fun s -> s.Length >= 6)
  }
```


# Detailed design
[design]: #detailed-design

At the time, preventing the overloading of the methods was a design choice to improve the code clarity.

After removing the protections that prevents the compilation of computation expression a custom operation is called, the state and arguments are tupled and passed to the method. When using the following builder:

```fsharp
type Builder() =
    member __.Yield(_) = ()
    
    [<CustomOperation("method")>]
    member __.Method(state, ...arguments) = ...

let builder = Builder()
```

with the code: 
```fsharp
builder {method a b c d e f}
```

That is essentially the same as calling:
```fsharp
builder.Method((builder.Yield()), a, b, c, d, e, f)
```

The same rules as calling this code will apply for the computation expressions.

The restriction of having a 1:1 match on the method and keyword names for the overloads is kept as it keeps the intent clear. However the overloads don't need to be marked with `[<CustomOperation>]` again.


### Consistency of attributes

When a group of overloads for a custom operator have inconsistent attribute (e.g. only one has MaintainsVarSpace) an error is given at 
any attempted use of tha operator.

A particular case is to do with ProjectionParameter.  A parameter at position 'i' is considered to have ProjectionParameter attribute for the translation
if all overloads have an argument at that position and have ProjectionParameter attribute.

Error messages gets more generic as it will give the same error as it would when calling a non-existing method if the custom operation don't match any overload.
