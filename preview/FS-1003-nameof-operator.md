# F# RFC FS-1003 - nameof Operator

The design suggestion [nameof operator](https://github.com/fsharp/fslang-suggestions/issues/252) has been marked "approved in principle".
This RFC covers the detailed proposal for this suggestion.

[Discussion thread](https://github.com/fsharp/FSharpLangDesign/issues/48)

* [x] Approved in principle
* [x] Details: [Resolved to Preview](https://github.com/fsharp/FSharpLangDesign/issues/48)
* [x] Implementation: [Complete to Preview](https://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp/pull/6325)

### Introduction

It's often useful to obtain the simple (unqualified) string name of a variable, type, or member. Today users end up writing something like this:

```fsharp
let add x y =
    if x < 0 then raise (ArgumentOutOfRangeException("x"))
    x + y
```

This RFC allows user code to extract the name of a declaration, like:

```fsharp
let add x y =
    if x < 0 then raise (ArgumentOutOfRangeException(nameof(x))
    x + y
```

### Naming 

The name of the operator is `nameof`. It is an intrinsic in FSharp.Core

### Scope of use

- can be used with method parameters

- can be used with local variables

- can be used with local (nested) functions

- can be used with local curried functions

- can be used with local tupled functions

- can be used with provided symbol names, i.e. generated by type providers

- can be used from inside a local function (needs to be let rec)

- can be used with member names

- can be used with static member names

- can be used with static property names

- can be used with names that are quoted in <code>``</code>

- can be used with names of operators like `+`, `|>`, `typeof`, `nameof`, ...

- can be used with generic functions/types

- can be used in attributes

- can be used with namespaces, `nameof(System.Diagnostics)`

- can be used with type names, `nameof(System.String)`

- can be used with module names, `nameof(FSharp.Collections.List)`

- can be used with operators, `nameof(+)`.  In this case, the construct evaluates to the compiled name of the operator.

Other considerations:

- the use of `nameof` is allowed in quotations, the substitution is still made at compile-time

- the text `nameof` may resolves to something user-defined (this avoids a breaking change)

- `nameof` may not used like a first-class function value, `let f = nameof ;; f x`

- `nameof` may not be used with pipe operator, `x |> nameof`

### Names of instance members 

Names of members must be static or come from an instance.

So the following code that attempts to get the name of an instance property with an instance of its containing class is not valid:

```fsharp
type C() =
    member __.M = ()
    
nameof C.M // Error!
```

But the following are valid::

```fsharp
type C() =
    static member M = ()
    member __.M2 = ()
    
nameof C.M // Yay :)

let c = C()
nameof c.M2 // Yay :)
```

### Names of overloaded members

When selecting an overloaded member, a type annotation may be necessary to select a member:
```fsharp

type MethodGroupNameOfTests() =
    member this.MethodGroup() = ()    
    member this.MethodGroup(i:int) = ()

    member this.MethodGroup1(i:int, f:float, s:string) = 0
    member this.MethodGroup1(f:float, l:int64) = "foo"
    member this.MethodGroup1(u:unit -> unit -> int, h: unit) : unit = ()

    member this.``single argument method group name lookup`` () =
        let b = nameof(this.MethodGroup)
        Assert.AreEqual("MethodGroup",b)

    member this.``multiple argument method group name lookup`` () =
        let b = nameof(this.MethodGroup1 : (float * int64 -> _))
        Assert.AreEqual("MethodGroup1",b)
```

### Names of generic type parameters not permitted

The `nameof` construct can't be used with type arguments, `let f<'t> (x : 't) = nameof 't`.  This is because syntactcially the argument to `nameof` is an expression, and not a type.

NOTE: this is being reconsidered.

### Performance considerations

This substitution should be done at compile time, no performance impact expected

## Alternatives

See also unresolved issues below.

#### Alternative: use a keyword not a library intrinsic

This would have been a breaking change

## Unresolved issues (for release from preview)

* [ ] `nameof` on an operator gives the compiled name of the operator

* [ ] Resolving instance members requires an artificial instance object.

* [ ] No way to get the name of a generic type parameter.

* [ ] Resolving overloaded members requires a type instantiation.
