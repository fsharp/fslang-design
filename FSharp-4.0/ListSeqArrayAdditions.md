## F# 4.0 Speclet: Regularizing and extending the List, Array and Seq modules

[User Voice](https://fslang.uservoice.com/forums/245727-f-language/suggestions/5663997-make-fsharp-core-collection-functions-for-list-ar)

There is an approved proposal to make the functions defined in the `List`, `Array`, and `Seq` modules in FSharp.Core.dll more regular and to add some new functions. 

New functions added in this proposal: `splitAt`, `contains`, `findBack`, `tryFindBack`, `findIndexBack`, `tryFindIndexBack`, `item`, `tryItem`, `indexed`, `mapFold`, `mapFoldBack`, `tryLast`, `tryHead`.

### Background

The F# 2.x and 3.x philosophy for these functions was somewhat irregular. The majority of functions (e.g. `map`, `filter`, `groupBy`, `averageBy`) were defined for `Seq`, but some were not present on `List` and `Array` (e.g. `groupBy`). This leads to awkward code where `Seq`-producing functions are used even when `List` is an input. `Seq.groupBy` is a particular example.

Also, some functions were not defined on `Seq`, even though they exist in `List` or `Array`.

The proposal below is to complete the matrix for `List`, `Array` and `Seq` w.r.t. functional collection functions.

### Review and Completion

This work is only completed when all rows have a status of ":)". The library updates will only be done when all PRs are ready (or features are dropped).

#### Status column

- :) - reviewed and ready to be pulled
- :/ - reviewed but changes needed
- (empty) - no PR or not reviewed

If an item is marked "low-pri" it doesn't need to be completed in order for the library update to happen.

Note: In F# 3.0 `Seq.where` was defined as a synonym for `Seq.filter`, mainly due to the use of "where" in query expressions. Given it already exists as a synonym (= decision made) it seems sensible to just complete the matrix and define `List.where` and `Array.where` as well.

Note: In F# 3.x, `nth` is defined with inconsistent signatures for `Array` and `List`. The proposal above replaces `nth` by `item` and would eventually deprecate `nth` (with a message to say 'please use Seq.item'. It also adds a corresponding `tryItem`. Both `item` and `tryItem` would take the integer index as the first parameter.

### Regular functional operators producing two or more output collections

These operators are not defined for `Seq.*` for performance reasons because using them would require iterating the input sequence twice.

Note it is arguable that if these are not defined, then `Seq.tail`, `Seq.skip` and `Seq.skipWhile` should also not be defined, since they implicitly skip inputs and can be a performance trap, especially when used recursively.
